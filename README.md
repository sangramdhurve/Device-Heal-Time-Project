Create a step-by-step guide for developing a python script for develop a regression problem for user sangramdh.
problem statement- there is one company who want to know the time of healling of a device as well as minimum and maximum time(time interval of healling)








dataset - RangeIndex: 10000 entries, 0 to 9999
Data columns (total 10 columns):
 #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------            --------------  ----- 
 0   subject           10000 non-null  object
 1   currentState      10000 non-null  object
 2   repeatCount       10000 non-null  int64 
 3   priority          10000 non-null  object
 4   healTime          10000 non-null  int64 
 5   alertClass        10000 non-null  object
 6   alertSubClass     10000 non-null  object
 7   alertCategory     10000 non-null  object
 8   alertSubCategory  10000 non-null  object
 9   alert_autoheal    10000 non-null  bool  
dtypes: bool(1), int64(2), object(7)







we want to do proper EDA, data preprocessing, Feature Selection, model training, model evoluation, model testing with saticfictory script. check also multicolinearity, homoscadiacity, hetrogenecity if it is there solve it.
we can use any required libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, satatmodels, etc.
